Milestone1: Fitness Plan Generator
Objective:

The objective of this milestone is to build a functional frontend fitness plan generator using Streamlit that:

•	Collects user inputs such as fitness goal, fitness level, and available equipment.

•	Generates a personalized workout recommendation based on selected inputs.

•	Demonstrates conditional logic for adaptive fitness planning.

•	Prepares the foundation for future AI/ML integration (e.g., LLM-powered workout generation).

This milestone focuses on creating a clean UI, structured logic, and scalable architecture for future enhancements like BMI calculation, diet planning, and AI-driven customization.
