Milestone1: Fitness Plan Generator
Objective
The objective of this milestone is to build a functional frontend fitness plan generator using Streamlit that:
•	Collects user inputs such as fitness goal, fitness level, and available equipment.
•	Generates a personalized workout recommendation based on selected inputs.
•	Demonstrates conditional logic for adaptive fitness planning.
•	Prepares the foundation for future AI/ML integration (e.g., LLM-powered workout generation).
This milestone focuses on creating a clean UI, structured logic, and scalable architecture for future enhancements like BMI calculation, diet planning, and AI-driven customization.

BMI Formula Explanation
What is BMI?
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a numerical value calculated using a person’s weight and height. It helps estimate whether a person falls within a healthy weight range.
BMI Formula
BMI is calculated using the formula:
Step-by-Step Explanation
1.	Measure weight in kilograms (kg).
2.	Measure height in meters (m).
3.	Square the height value (height × height).
4.	Divide weight by the squared height.
Example
If a person weighs 70 kg and is 1.75 m tall:
•	Height squared = 1.75 × 1.75 = 3.0625
•	BMI = 70 / 3.0625 = 22.86
BMI Categories (Standard WHO Classification)
•	Below 18.5 → Underweight
•	18.5 – 24.9 → Normal weight
•	25.0 – 29.9 → Overweight
•	30.0 and above → Obese
